- Date: 2026-10-03
- Surface: Repository / engineering workflow
- Change: Established GitHub canonical source of truth, secret scanning, baseline validation, audit JSON fix, and critical frontend dependency fixes.
- Expected user impact: No intended user-facing behavior change except inventory settings now reliably returns costConfigured and no longer fails when audit payload contains Prisma Decimal.
- Negative-risk review: Critical inventory suite, full critical suite, frontend tests and unit tests passed after fixes.
- Compatibility: Preserved existing API behavior; restored expected response field.
- Rollback: Revert merged PRs #1/#2 if regression is proven.
- Evidence: 52/52 frontend, 26/26 backend unit, 83/83 critical E2E, Gitleaks clean.
- Status: PASS
